# Holomesh – Solana-Powered Decentralized Social Layer

## Overview
Holomesh is a **Solana-based decentralized social ecosystem** merging real-world identity, community, and commerce into one interoperable platform.  
It uses **Reclaim Protocol** for **on-chain verification of credentials, proof of personhood, and digital achievements**, creating a trust mesh across social, educational, and professional communities.  

Holomesh empowers users to **own their social graph, monetize interactions, and carry verified reputation across Web3 and Web2**.


## Problem Statement
- Traditional social networks are centralized, siloed, and non-verifiable.  
- Communities on Telegram, Discord, or X cannot authenticate users, leading to scams and spam.  
- Users cannot port verified reputation across ecosystems, limiting interoperability with DePIN, DeFi, and DAOs.

---

## Solution
Holomesh solves these problems by:  
1. **Verifiable Identity:** Connect social/professional proofs via Reclaim, earning **Holobadges**.  
2. **Community Webs:** DAOs, clubs, and campuses create nodes forming a verified network.  
3. **Reputation Bridge:** Universal profile carries credentials & trust scores across apps.  
4. **On-Chain Utility:** Communities issue gated roles, token rewards, and credentials on **Solana**.
