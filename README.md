# Holomesh – Solana-Powered Decentralized Social Layer


## Overview
Holomesh is a **Solana-based decentralized social ecosystem** merging real-world identity, community, and commerce into one interoperable platform.  
It uses **Reclaim Protocol** for **on-chain verification of credentials, proof of personhood, and digital achievements**, creating a trust mesh across social, educational, and professional communities.  

Holomesh empowers users to **own their social graph, monetize interactions, and carry verified reputation across Web3 and Web2**.


## Problem Statement
- Traditional social networks are centralized, siloed, and non-verifiable.  
- Communities on Telegram, Discord, or X cannot authenticate users, leading to scams and spam.  
- Users cannot port verified reputation across ecosystems, limiting interoperability with DePIN, DeFi, and DAOs.


## Solution
Holomesh solves these problems by:  
1. **Verifiable Identity:** Connect social/professional proofs via Reclaim, earning **Holobadges**.  
2. **Community Webs:** DAOs, clubs, and campuses create nodes forming a verified network.  
3. **Reputation Bridge:** Universal profile carries credentials & trust scores across apps.  
4. **On-Chain Utility:** Communities issue gated roles, token rewards, and credentials on **Solana**.

## Key Features
- On-chain identity verification via Solana + Reclaim  
- Tokenized reputation & rewards  
- **Holomaps** – visualized verified networks  
- Community-driven incentive system  
- Interoperable social credentials for Web3 & Web2  

## Roadmap
| Quarter | Milestone | Tasks | Metrics |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Q4 2025** | MVP & Reclaim Integration | Launch Web Alpha, implement Reclaim login & proof APIs, onboard 100 beta users | 95% verification success |
| **Q1 2026** | Community Network & Holomap | Deploy community mesh, enable group creation & wallet-linked rewards | 20+ verified communities, ≥500 members |
| **Q2 2026** | Reputation Economy Launch | Release reputation dashboard, token-based incentives, public launch | ≥2,000 active users, 10 partnerships |


## Primary KPIs
- Active Users: ≥2,000 by Q2 2026  
- Community Nodes: 20+ verified communities  
- Verification Success Rate: ≥95%  
- Token Reward Distribution: ≥80% claimed  
- Retention: ≥80% post-beta  


## Hackathon Alignment
- **Impact:** Solves tangible social & identity issues.  
- **Execution:** MVP ready for Solana demo, integrating **Reclaim & tokenized reputation**.  
- **Community & Mentorship Fit:** Aligned with Superteam Balkan mentorship.  
- **Blockchain Relevance:** Solana central for fast, low-fee verification.  
- **Wow Factor:** “LinkedIn + Discord + Lens Protocol” fusion in a decentralized, reputation-aware network.


## Technical Stack
- **Blockchain:** Solana  
- **Identity Verification:** Reclaim Protocol  
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js / Mobile Web App  
- **Smart Contracts:** Rust (Anchor framework)  
- **Data Storage:** On-chain verification + optional IPFS  
- **Tokens & Incentives:** SPL tokens for rewards

## Security Statement

At Holomesh, security is a core design principle, not an afterthought.
Our goal is to ensure that every user interaction, credential verification, and community transaction is secure, verifiable, and privacy-preserving.

1. Identity & Credential Verification

Holomesh leverages Reclaim Protocol to handle all credential proofs in a zero-knowledge manner.
This means that users can verify ownership of social or professional identities (e.g., GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, Wallets) without exposing raw credentials.
No sensitive data is stored on our servers, proofs are verified directly on-chain.

2. Smart Contract Security

Our smart contracts are written in Rust using the Anchor framework, which enforces strict type-safety and predictable behavior during runtime.
We follow best practices including:

Code modularization and consistent linting

Explicit checks for authorization and ownership

Unit testing for core contract functions

Avoidance of reentrancy and unchecked external calls


Before mainnet deployment, the contracts will undergo a third-party audit to ensure zero-critical vulnerabilities remain.

3. Data Privacy & Storage

Holomesh uses IPFS for decentralized storage of optional metadata, ensuring that users maintain control over their data.
Only non-sensitive identifiers (hashes, proof IDs, and badge metadata) are written on-chain, no personal information is ever exposed or retrievable by third parties.

4. Wallet & Transaction Layer

All interactions (login, reward claiming, community creation) are executed via Solana wallet signatures (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack).
Private keys remain with the user — Holomesh never requests custody or private key access.
Transaction payloads are verified client-side before submission to Solana RPC endpoints.

5. Continuous Security Awareness

We consider security an ongoing process.
The Holomesh team actively monitors dependencies and libraries for vulnerabilities, plans periodic code reviews, and will adopt Adevar Labs’ audit recommendations if selected.
Our roadmap also includes implementing multi-sig governance for key admin operations in Q2 2026.

## Deployment & Usage

This section explains how to set up and interact with the Holomesh prototype using the Solana and Anchor frameworks.
(Note: The following commands use placeholder examples. Replace them with actual paths and program IDs once your smart contracts are live.)

## Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure you have the following installed:

Solana CLI (v1.18 or higher)

Anchor Framework

Node.js (v18 or later)

NPM or Yarn

## Local Setup

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/Holomesh.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd Holomesh

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Build smart contracts (Anchor)
anchor build

## Deployment

# Deploy smart contracts to Solana Devnet
anchor deploy

# Confirm deployment (replace PROGRAM_ID with your actual one)
solana program show <PROGRAM_ID>

## Running the Frontend

# Start the web app locally
npm run dev

## Once started, visit:
http://localhost:3000 to access the Holomesh dashboard.

## Usage Flow

1. Connect Wallet: Use Phantom or Solflare wallet to sign in.


2. Verify Identity: Complete on-chain verification via Reclaim Protocol.


3. Create / Join Communities: Form or join verified groups.


4. Earn Rewards: Interact and receive Holotokens as incentives.


5. Explore Holomap: Visualize your verified network in real time.
6.
